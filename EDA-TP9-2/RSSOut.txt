<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital have developed an accurate, scalable approach for monitoring cancer DNA from blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reporting in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the team demonstrates that nearly 90 percent of a tumor’s genetic features can be detected in blood samples using whole-exome sequencing, and that the method can be effectively applied in up to 49 percent of patients with advanced cancer — a number likely to increase as sequencing becomes cheaper. This less-invasive tumor sampling, which can provide a window into the cancer’s genome, has a range of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our ultimate hope is to use blood biopsies to exhaustively search for and characterize even the smallest remnants of tumors,” explains Viktor Adalsteinsson, co-first author on the paper and group leader at the Broad Institute, where he leads the Blood Biopsy Team. “And, as tumors evolve in more advanced stages of cancer, developing resistance or becoming metastatic, we might access timepoints that could be pivotal in deciding which therapies are right for that patient.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This ability to detect and analyze cancer DNA from a patient’s blood sample is emerging as a promising alternative to invasive surgical biopsies, which can be difficult, painful, and costly — especially when tumors have appeared in locations that are challenging to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood biopsies (also called liquid biopsies) are poised to overcome many of these issues. They have the potential to allow doctors to track the progress of disease and treatment in real-time and to help researchers understand how tumors resist treatment with far greater resolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding cancer without invasive procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cells in the body, including tumor cells, regularly expel fragments of DNA into the bloodstream when they die. With blood biopsies, clinicians collect this “cell-free” DNA from a blood draw and then detect and comprehensively profile the fragments originating from cancer cells. Tracking these data could make it possible to monitor cancer recurrence, a patient’s response to treatment, and other clinically important features, all from blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research and development arena for blood biopsies is frequented by both academic and industry players, but with scalable whole-exome sequencing, a team led by Adalsteinsson and colleagues Gavin Ha, Sam Freeman, Matthew Meyerson, J. Christopher Love, and Gad Getz is taking the field in a new and innovative direction. Love is a Broad associate member, associate professor of chemical engineering at MIT, and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compiling a whole exome from DNA fragments currently requires at least 10 percent tumor DNA in a blood sample, but the fraction of tumor DNA in the blood can vary wildly from patient to patient. Because of this variation, the team first desired an unbiased approach for detecting and measuring levels of cancer DNA before attempting whole-exome sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the field, many blood biopsy methods detect tumor DNA by screening for mutations in known cancer-related genes, but this targeted sequencing misses cancers without those mutations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Co-first author Ha, a postdoc at the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), led the development of a tool called ichorCNA that can analyze DNA fragments for mutation patterns nearly universal in cancer genomes, and as a result capture cancers with both known and unknown mutations. Ha focused on detecting stretches of DNA that have either fewer or greater copies in cancer cells, in contrast to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team tested and refined ichorCNA on 1,439 blood samples collected prospectively from 520 metastatic breast or prostate cancer patients at DFCI (a significant effort championed by medical oncologists Atish Choudhury, Daniel Stover, Heather Parsons, Nikhil Wagle, and colleagues).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, the researchers found that in 33 to 49 percent of the metastatic breast and prostate cancer patients, depending upon whether one or multiple blood samples were examined, tumor DNA made up greater than 10 percent of the cell-free DNA in their blood — enough to make whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA feasible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, to determine whether this sequencing of cell-free tumor DNA could offer the same level of insight into cancer genetics as a tissue biopsy could, the team compared surgically obtained tumor biopsies to data collected from whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA from a group of 41 patients. The researchers found that genetic data from blood whole-exome sequencing and tissue biopsies matched significantly across a number of genetic features, such as clonal somatic mutations (88 percent match) and copy number alterations (80 percent match).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results support cell-free DNA whole-exome sequencing, from blood samples, as a potential substitute for metastatic tumor biopsy sequencing for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our study has demonstrated that we can get a cancer whole exome reliably, from blood; that it reflects the matched tumor biopsy; and that it can be done for a significant fraction of patients with metastatic cancer,” says Adalsteinsson, who was a postdoc in Love’s lab before joining the Broad Institute. “This validation suggests that we can use blood biopsies for large-scale genomic characterization of disease in patients with metastatic cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It unlocks the potential for a lot of studies that we couldn’t do before,” adds Getz, institute member and director of the Cancer Genome Computational Analysis group at Broad and associate professor of Pathology and director of Bioinformatics at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Department of Pathology. “The technology will allow us to track the dynamics of cancer and understand the evolution of drug resistance, or the development of the metastatic state, in a way that isn’t possible through surgical biopsies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study improves the analysis pipeline for blood biopsies and allows it to be performed at expanded scale. The researchers are actively applying their work to thousands of patients with metastatic cancer who may otherwise not have their tumors biopsied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With this work, we now have a framework for the precise measurement and quality control of tumor DNA in the plasma, enabling the genomic analysis of blood biopsies with high technical accuracy,” explains Meyerson, institute member at Broad and professor of pathology at DFCI and Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method is already in use with patients for cancer research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the back of the team’s success, ichorCNA and subsequent whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA have been incorporated into a collaboration with the Broad Institute Genomics Platform to enable comprehensive mapping of metastatic and drug-resistant tumors from blood samples at scale. This approach has also been integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadinstitute.org/node/129806/&quot;&gt;direct-to-patient research efforts&lt;/a&gt; underway at Broad, including the Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Project, a patient outreach effort that collects saliva and tissue samples — and now blood samples — donated from metastatic breast cancer patients for DNA sequencing to further therapeutic research. Similar efforts to incorporate blood biopsies are underway in the Angiosarcoma Project and upcoming Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are excited about using blood biopsies to understand metastatic breast cancer, drug resistance, and tumor evolution, and to get a snapshot of the metastatic setting in patients who might not have available tissue from a metastatic biopsy,” says Nikhil Wagle, an associate member at the Broad Institute, deputy director of the Center for Cancer Precision Medicine at DFCI, and leader of the MBC Project. “With the Blood Biopsy Team’s latest results, it was clear that this technology had reached the right point for us to incorporate into the Metastatic Breast Cancer project.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A means to perform large-scale blood biopsies could allow researchers and clinicians easy access to the cancer genome, with exciting implications for the way physicians monitor response to treatment, watch for recurrence, and more. The ability to frequently and noninvasively monitor cancer and its treatment could alter clinical trials, increase the resolution with which clinicians understand metastatic cancer, and potentially increase accessibility to quality precision medicine approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Using cell-free DNA to track cancer is not a new idea, but we’re developing the tools to understand how we can better qualify materials for those types of analyses, and we’re doing it in a way that allows us to look across the genome broadly,” says Love. “We’ve established quality metrics to make sure that this technology is cost-effective and scalable for thousands of patients and samples a year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was funded by the Gerstner Family Foundation, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and a Koch Institute Support (core) grant from the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>System could pore through millions of research papers to extract “recipes” for producing materials.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/artificial-intelligence-aids-materials-fabrication-1106</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, research efforts such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mgi.gov/&quot;&gt;Materials Genome Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2014/materials-database-proves-its-mettle-with-new-discoveries-0204&quot;&gt;Materials Project&lt;/a&gt; have produced a wealth of computational tools for designing new materials useful for a range of applications, from energy and electronics to aeronautics and civil engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But developing processes for producing those materials has continued to depend on a combination of experience, intuition, and manual literature reviews.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at MIT, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and the University of California at Berkeley hope to close that materials-science automation gap, with a new artificial-intelligence system that would pore through research papers to deduce “recipes” for producing particular materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Computational materials scientists have made a lot of progress in the ‘what’ to make — what material to design based on desired properties,” says Elsa Olivetti, the Atlantic Richfield Assistant Professor of Energy Studies in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE). “But because of that success, the bottleneck has shifted to, ‘Okay, now how do I make it?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision a database that contains materials recipes extracted from millions of papers. Scientists and engineers could enter the name of a target material and any other criteria — precursor materials, reaction conditions, fabrication processes — and pull up suggested recipes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a step toward realizing that vision, Olivetti and her colleagues have developed a machine-learning system that can analyze a research paper, deduce which of its paragraphs contain materials recipes, and classify the words in those paragraphs according to their roles within the recipes: names of target materials, numeric quantities, names of pieces of equipment, operating conditions, descriptive adjectives, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a paper appearing in the latest issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Chemistry of Materials&lt;/em&gt;, they also demonstrate that a machine-learning system can analyze the extracted data to infer general characteristics of classes of materials — such as the different temperature ranges that their synthesis requires — or particular characteristics of individual materials — such as the different physical forms they will take when their fabrication conditions vary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olivetti is the senior author on the paper, and she’s joined by Edward Kim, an MIT graduate student in DMSE; Kevin Huang, a DMSE postdoc; Adam Saunders and Andrew McCallum, computer scientists at UMass Amherst; and Gerbrand Ceder, a Chancellor’s Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling in the gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained their system using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques. “Supervised” means that the training data fed to the system is first annotated by humans; the system tries to find correlations between the raw data and the annotations. “Unsupervised” means that the training data is unannotated, and the system instead learns to cluster data together according to structural similarities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because materials-recipe extraction is a new area of research, Olivetti and her colleagues didn’t have the luxury of large, annotated data sets accumulated over years by diverse teams of researchers. Instead, they had to annotate their data themselves — ultimately, about 100 papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By machine-learning standards, that’s a pretty small data set. To improve it, they used an algorithm developed at Google called Word2vec. Word2vec looks at the contexts in which words occur — the words’ syntactic roles within sentences and the other words around them — and groups together words that tend to have similar contexts. So, for instance, if one paper contained the sentence “We heated the titanium tetracholoride to 500 C,” and another contained the sentence “The sodium hydroxide was heated to 500 C,” Word2vec would group “titanium tetracholoride” and “sodium hydroxide” together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Word2vec, the researchers were able to greatly expand their training set, since the machine-learning system could infer that a label attached to any given word was likely to apply to other words clustered with it. Instead of 100 papers, the researchers could thus train their system on around 640,000 papers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip of the iceberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test the system’s accuracy, however, they had to rely on the labeled data, since they had no criterion for evaluating its performance on the unlabeled data. In those tests, the system was able to identify with 99 percent accuracy the paragraphs that contained recipes and to label with 86 percent accuracy the words within those paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that further work will improve the system’s accuracy, and in ongoing work they are exploring a battery of deep learning techniques that can make further generalizations about the structure of materials recipes, with the goal of automatically devising recipes for materials not considered in the existing literature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of Olivetti’s prior research has concentrated on finding more cost-effective and environmentally responsible ways to produce useful materials, and she hopes that a database of materials recipes could abet that project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is landmark work,&quot; says Ram Seshadri, the Fred and Linda R. Wudl Professor of Materials Science at the University of California at Santa Barbara. “The authors have taken on the difficult and ambitious challenge of capturing, through AI methods, strategies employed for the preparation of new materials. The work demonstrates the power of machine learning, but it would be accurate to say that the eventual judge of success or failure would require convincing practitioners that the utility of such methods can enable them to abandon their more instinctual approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why we should welcome warnings</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/starr-forum-welcome-warnings-1103</link>
    <description>At MIT event, experts call for a new approach to worst-case scenarios.</description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear accidents. Sea level rise. Terror threats. The world is full of potential catastrophes, but most of the time, most of us are oblivious to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, at times, experts warn the rest of us about these potential crises. Sometimes those warnings work, but many times they go unheeded. Why do we ignore information we could use to stave off a disaster?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prominent national security expert Richard Clarke SM ’79 weighed in on this issue at MIT’s latest Starr Forum event on Wednesday, making the case that we should be more receptive to the possibility of dire news, as well as more systematic about analyzing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clarke, the former chief counter-terrorism advisor on the National Security Council, expanded on ideas in his new book, “Warnings,” asserting that specialists in a range of fields can “see the thing buried in the data that other people don’t see. They see it first.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clarke called these people “Cassandras,” after the figure in Greek mythology who could see the future, and described them as experts with accumulated knowledge and a willingness to explore worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It just can’t be any old person off the street saying the sky is falling,” Clarke said. “It&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;has to be a recognized, acknowledged expert in the field they were giving the warning in. … They had to have studied it and been data-driven.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prove me wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examples of this dynamic abound. Engineers warned that Japan’s nuclear power industry was vulnerable to natural disasters well before the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami of 2011. Experts stated that New Orleans was vulnerable to flooding before Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. Climate scientists, for decades, have warned the world that global warming could upend life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And Clarke, for his part, gained a significant public profile after being one of the U.S. security officials most concerned about the threat of the al Qaeda terror group before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But plenty of dire-sounding warnings can also be unfounded and ultimately incorrect. So how can leaders — in government, business, or elsewhere — distinguish between legitimate fears and simplistic scare-mongering?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To Clarke, a person with a legitimate warning to offer will be willing to have their ideas tested by others: “Cassandras repeatedly say, ‘Well, I gave my data to other experts in the field and said, prove me wrong, and none of them could. They could never prove my data wrong.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not act?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if experts are often raising concerns, why do those warnings get ignored? Clarke emphasized that being quick to recognize concerns produces its own set of problems, starting with a lack of consensus. When experts are “yelling to a decison maker, ‘There’s a problem,’ the decision maker says, ‘Yeah? Who else believes you? What other experts in the field agree?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then too, Clarke said, data-based concerns over catastrophes can be ignored due to what he calls “first occurrence syndrome,” namely, the fact that many potential problems have “never happened before, in the memory of the people involved.” New Orleans, for example, had never previously flooded to the degree that it did due to Hurricane Katrina. It is easier to imagine that history will continue within its recent bounds. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Clarke noted, there can be a “diffusion of accountability” in organizations. One data scientist repeatedly told the firm Equifax recently that it was vulnerable to being hacked, he said. But the responsibility for acting on that was essentially distributed among several people — which can lead to institutional inertia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Clarke added, to stave off disast
00003A0B
er, especially in matters related to climate change, “You might have to do something ideologically abhorrent to you. You might have to raise taxes or try carbon capture or enact regulations.” Thus solutions mean to pre-empt catastrophes of all kinds can languish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the sea rise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum consists of a series of public discussions, sponsored by MIT’s Center for International Studies, focused on global security issues and other matters of international politics. About 125 people attended the event Wednesday, which was open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clarke’s remarks were followed by a dialogue with counterintelligence expert and Center for International Studies Fellow Joel Brenner, as well as a question-and-answer session with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Clarke observed that being a “Cassandra” can take a heavy psychological toll on experts who find their ideas marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these people get agitated when they are ignored,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brenner largely concurred, but wryly noted that “a lot of these people have a special talent for burning bridges” within the organizations they are serving. Still, Brenner noted, the complications of contemporary society and technology mean it is generally safe to assume, at any given time, that “something is going seriously wrong somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked to produce a hierarchy of issues for us to worry about, Clarke emphasized the vast problems that sea level rise, as a product of climate change, could create in the decades ahead. Rather than the consensus estimate of 3 meters of sea level rise by the year 2100, Clarke stated, we could see 6 to 9 meters of sea level rise by 2050 or 2075.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Think about the economic, political, social implications of that,” Clarke said. “Some countries diappear. Mass migrations of people.” He also cited the potential for economic “collapse” in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, Clarke did try to inject some hope into the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I believe in good government’s ability to be rational and save the world from some of these disasters,” Clarke said, adding: “I think it’s an optimistic book, because it holds out the hope that if you had systematic thinking [and] rational analysis, systems thinking, if you want to call it that, we could see problems coming, and stop them from being really big problems.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>“A good negotiator can be exactly who you are&amp;quot;</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/class-negotiation-skills-1103</link>
    <description>Bruno Verdini leads a popular new class on negotiation skills.</description>
     <pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 23:59:59 -0400</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/class-negotiation-skills-1103</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Marol Escajeda ’17 is trained in materials science and engineering, yet she finds that success on the job pivots on her leadership and negotiation abilities. “Your skills have to extend beyond your technical field,” says Escajeda, a materials and processes engineer at the aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman. “You need the ability to handle intense interpersonal situations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She and Matthew Basile ’17, an electrical engineering and computer science major, earned their undergraduate degrees at MIT last year. Now a program manager at Microsoft, Basile says: “My current job is nontechnical. I’m working with engineers to get product features implemented on time. I rely on advocacy skills.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These young engineers are former students in 11.011 (The Art and Science of Negotiation), which has grown into one of the most popular and highest-ranked Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences electives at MIT. “It was one of the best classes I took at MIT,” Escajeda says. Basile is similarly enthusiastic: “In all honesty, 11.011 was by far the most relevant class for what I’m doing now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While at MIT, Escajeda and Basile also participated in the Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership (GEL) Program, which helps develop leadership skills among more than 120 undergraduates per year. “If you appreciate the value of personal interaction, 11.011 is for you,” Escajeda says. “Like with GEL, you’ll get out what you put in, and you’ll find it really applicable to life beyond engineering classes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking people skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The popularity of 11.011 coincides with the arrival of Bruno Verdini, a recent MIT PhD graduate in “Negotiation, Communication, Diplomacy, and Leadership” — an interdepartmental degree he negotiated into existence. In the spring of 2016, Eran Ben-Joseph, the chair of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, invited Verdini to teach the undergraduate course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The transformation of 11.011 was immediate. Verdini redesigned the entire course syllabus, introducing 25 new sessions with new readings and new negotiation exercises. He capped the class size at 42 to guarantee familiarity with every student and optimize weekly role-playing simulations, which involve practicing communication, collaboration, and leadership strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The subject’s popularity skyrocketed. The course had previously attracted about 35 students per year. In the fall of 2016, 85 students from all five schools and more than 20 departments preregistered for 11.011; in spring 2017, there were 180, and this semester there were 230.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm for 11.011 is evidence, Verdini says, of a broader emphasis in students’ core concerns. “MIT students don’t want to get put in a corner in the workplace to only do things that require technical dexterity, while other people do the management,” he says. “They want to develop their people skills and showcase their strategic vision. And they want more professional recognition for their abilities in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons Verdini structured the course around peer-to-peer feedback. He aims to empower both those students in the class and on the teaching team to take center stage in negotiation coaching. “One of the coolest parts of 11.011 is the guidance from the TAs,” Basile says.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makings of a good negotiator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Verdini’s career is marked by firsts. Not only did he develop a path to his own PhD at MIT, but for his doctoral work in water, environmental, and energy negotiations between countries, he was the first MIT recipient of the Harvard Law School Award for the Best Research of the Year in Negotiation, Decision-Making, Mediation, and Dispute Resolution. This also marked the first time the award went to someone born and raised in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This spring, Verdini will offer 11.111 (The Art and Science of Negotiation, Advanced Applications), “one of the first advanced undergraduate courses in negotiation at a top U.S. university,” says his mentor Professor Lawrence Susskind, one of the founding fathers of the conflict resolution field with five decades of expertise. The upper-level course is a direct response to student demand for more of the material — and more of Verdini.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His ability to ignite passion for negotiation is a common theme in course evaluations from the last three semesters. Students discover passion in themselves, and see it in him. “Even when sick, exhausted, or in a horrible mood, I dragged myself out of bed for his lectures,” wrote Tatyana Gubin, co-founder of a thriving startup, in the fall of 2016. “And I would leave inspired, educated, and ready to tackle the next negotiation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Negotiation allows you to share your values and principles with others,” says Verdini, also executive director of the MIT-Harvard Mexico Negotiation Program and author of &lt;em&gt;Winning Together: The Natural Resource Negotiation Playbook&lt;/em&gt;, which is published by MIT Press and hits the bookshelves this December. “Our world suffers when people disconnect intellectual decisions from what they feel inside. My teaching and research is structured as a personal journey that centers around negotiation as a means to get to know yourself better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT students often enter his class aware of only one side of themselves, Verdini adds. They might see themselves as shy, or guarded, or without the personality to be a good negotiator. They discover otherwise. “A good negotiator can be exactly who you are — caring, attentive, and someone who thinks of others,” he says. “You can be all of those things and at the same time lead and facilitate solutions to make a better world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben-Joseph says the class serves the wider undergraduate population by, among other things, shifting their thinking in new ways. “Students learn that negotiation is part of how you deal with ethics, with power, with politics, with decision making,” he says. “They come out of this class more rounded and sensitive adults as they enter the workforce and deal with issues of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2018, MIT students will have an opportunity to take a deeper dive into such thinking with a new HASS Concentration in Negotiation and Leadership, which will offer a diverse roster of classes in the relevant subject area to fulfill an Institute requirement designed to deepen and broaden student learning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT chemical engineering alumna Alexandria Miskho ’17, who consults in New York City on how businesses account for climate risks, is a former 11.011 teaching assistant who was at the forefront of student-led efforts to create the concentration. “We need to enter the world with a comprehensive negotiation toolkit,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jillian Dressler has discovered as much,&amp;nbsp;in tandem with many of her professional female colleagues.&amp;nbsp;Dressler, a senior in civil and environmental engineering, says 11.011 empowered her to push back against discrimination. “As many of us have unfortunately experienced,&amp;nbsp;there are times when I’ve been made to feel uncomfortable as a woman,” says Dressler, now a teaching assistant in the course. “I would never have possessed the&amp;nbsp;resolve&amp;nbsp;to initiate a conversation about it before 11.011. Now I do. I take on difficult situations. I’ve discovered strengths that I never knew I had.”&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 4, MIT.nano and the Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) received a visit from José Antonio Fernández Carbajal, chair of the board of Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), casually known as Monterrey Tec. Fernandez Carbajal was at MIT for his first meeting as the newest member of the MIT Corporation&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;reserved time to tour MIT.nano and get an update on its progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monterrey Tec is a private, nonprofit, independent institution in Mexico known for its emphasis on social responsibility and entrepreneurship. It was founded in 1943 by Don Eugenio Garza Sada, who graduated from MIT with a bachelor&#039;s degree&amp;nbsp;in civil engineering in 1914, just before the new Cambridge, Massachusetts campus opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, MIT and Monterrey Tec established a program, MIT-Tec, designed to support the Tec in its quest to become a world-class research university. Initiated by Vladimir Bulović, associate dean for innovation and director of MIT.nano, and led by MTL Director Jesús del Alamo, the&amp;nbsp;program hosts research visits of Monterrey Tec’s students, postdocs, and faculty at MIT in the general areas of nanotechnology and nanoscience.&amp;nbsp;To date, eight different research groups at MIT have a
00004000
lready hosted extended stays for&amp;nbsp;five Monterrey Tec students, seven postdocs, and four professors. Eight more are scheduled to arrive in the next few months. Their areas of research encompass microfluidics, nanostructures for biomedical applications, telecommunications, nanoscale 3-D printing, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and organ-on-a-chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hands-on research underpins a robust and&amp;nbsp;growing program of MIT-Tec educational exchanges. In May 2016, the &quot;MIT Day at the Tec: Workshop on Sensors and Actuators&quot; hosted 11 MIT and 12 Tec technical presentations at the Monterey Tec campus. Over the last three years at MIT, more than 70 Tec students, postdocs, and professors have attended the MTL nanoLab, a one-week hands-on course on nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monterrey Tec is an esteemed partner of MIT.nano, which will open its new building&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;mid-2018. Visiting Monterrey Tec students, postdocs, and faculty will be conducting research in the new state-of-the-art facility, including the prototyping facility, which will be named in recognition and appreciation of Monterrey Tec and its valued partnership with MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Author Édouard Louis examines contexts for violence</title>

    <description>The acclaimed writer, whose work has become a cause célèbre in France and beyond, speaks as part of the MIT Global France Seminar series.</description>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-author-edouard-louis-examines-contexts-for-violence-1102</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the MIT Global France Seminar on Oct. 27, author Édouard Louis demonstrated to an overflow MIT audience why his writing has become a cause célèbre in France and beyond. During the event, the fourth in this year’s lecture and discussion series, the 25-year-old Louis read from work that simultaneously links the personal to the political and that describes, with brutal candor, growing up poor, gay, and persecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar series, sponsored by the French Initiatives Endowment Fund, was founded by Bruno Perreau, the Cynthia L. Reed Associate Professor of French Studies, who also served as the event&#039;s moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis introduced his talk in eye-opening fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we consider politics to be the governance of human beings by other human beings and the existence of individuals within a community that they didn’t choose, then politics is the distinction between populations where life is supported, promoted, protected, and populations that are exposed to persecution, murder, and death,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the evening, Louis drew on vivid and often savage details from his personal history —&amp;nbsp;a trademark of his writing. His first book, &quot;The End of Eddy,&quot;&amp;nbsp;is an autobiographical novel describing the flight of Eddy Bellegueule (Louis’ name at birth) from his working-class family and the village of Hallencourt in northern France.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A bestseller in France and translated into dozens of languages, the novel describes what it is like growing up poor, queer, and bookish in a family that struggles to put food on the table, and derides both homosexuality and education. Shamed and physically bullied by family and schoolmates, Louis escaped to university in Paris, where he turned to writing as a way not just of examining the violence he was exposed to growing up, but as a way of understanding the context in which such violence could arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses to violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you suffer from violence all your life, in the end you inflict it upon others, for example, upon gays, upon what people call ‘strangers,’” Louis has said in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of unemployment and hardscrabble lives his family and others endured in Hallencourt was a form of violence, he said, perpetrated on this community by an indifferent state. And this violence cascades beyond its immediate victims.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The preoccupation with violence is central to his most recent work: &quot;History of Violence: A Novel,&quot; which will appear in English translation in summer 2018. The novel concerns the story of a romantic liaison on Christmas Eve 2012 that goes terribly wrong, leading to Louis’ rape and near-death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as Louis explained to his MIT audience, the conventional means of securing justice through the French legal system did not sit right with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Talking about this trauma with the police, they made more suffering and punishment,” said Louis. “They took pictures of my body, humiliating me, stealing my body again, and used these pictures to put somebody in jail.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis also learned that his assaulter had previously served time, and had his own difficult history. “The guy was violent, but I didn’t want him in jail, I didn’t want my body used to inflict hurt and revenge, creating more violence,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Politics as a matter of life and death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This capacity to transform personal suffering into a meditation on the larger wounds society inflicts on the powerless and marginalized defines Louis’ literary voice. He read excerpts from a new work, a series of vignettes about his relationship to his father, addressed to his father, who lies tethered to a machine to help him breathe — the victim of a factory accident years ago that left him permanently disabled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“After I ran away, I said I hated you, and felt the need to tell others I detested you. ... You told people in a café you’d have preferred a different son. I felt like I wanted to die. When you drank you said you didn’t understand. You were a victim as much of the violence you dispensed as the violence you endured.’”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Louis described policies enacted by a succession of French leaders that took a terrible toll on his father’s health. For instance, in 2006, then-French President Jacques Chirac raised the cost of medicine his father needed to avoid digestive disorders: “Chirac made you sick to your stomach.” And when President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to reduce welfare benefits to encourage a return to work by the poor, Louis father was forced to accept a job as street sweeper in a city 40 miles away, in spite of his disastrous health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sarkozy broke your back,” said Louis. “Politics is a question of life and death.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The effects of inequities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a question-and-answer session&amp;nbsp;with the audience, Louis suggested that the rise of right wing extremism worldwide, often linked to attacks on vulnerable communities, flows from class inequities that leave the working class neglected and powerless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“The reason why people from my village voted for Le Pen, or people here voted for your president is because there is a lack of representation for the working class,” said Louis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Confronting structural inequality and violence, Louis concluded, must involve acknowledging the reality of the working class and that their oppression shares a common root with the persecution of gay, immigrant, and racial minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The world is so full of fiction, with leaders who lie to us, and pretend to help people like my family when they only care about the rich,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether through academic research, writing novels, painting, or demonstrating, he said, “it is urgent, it is necessary to build new spaces to address the question of domination and exclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MIT joins court brief in support of “Dreamers”</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-joins-court-brief-support-dreamers-1102</link>
    <description>Legal filing is part of larger set of Institute actions to aid DACA students.</description>
     <pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-joins-court-brief-support-dreamers-1102</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT, together with 18 peer institutions, has filed an amicus curiae brief in a federal court lawsuit challenging the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — part of a growing set of Institute actions designed to support MIT community members affected by changes to federal immigration policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the brief, the schools focus on the effects the repeal of DACA will have on their DACA-protected students and recent graduates whose status as U.S. residents depends on the program; the impact that ending DACA would have on the institutions’ ability to attract the most talented students; and the loss to the nation if these individuals are not able to stay in the U.S. and use their talents and education to contribute to society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those students, the brief notes, are some of the most gifted and motivated young people in the world. However, with the repeal of DACA, the brief adds, many students now risk being unable to obtain the “full and complete education” they have been working toward since being brought to the U.S. as children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;U.S. residents dependent on DACA are often referred to as “Dreamers,” after the proposed legislation known as the “DREAM Act,” which was introduced in Congress over a decade ago but has not yet passed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brief highlights the real-life situations of a number of undocumented students and recent graduates, including two MIT students — one a recent graduate, the other still enrolled — who have benefited from the protections afforded by DACA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of them, Jose Gomez ’17, an aerospace engineering major who participated in NASA research as an MIT student, was brought to the U.S. by his family at age 5; he is now working for a robotics startup and is a public advocate for DACA. The other, sophomore Johan Villanueva, is a chemical engineering major who graduated second in his class from Chicago’s largest public high school after serving as a co-captain of the math team, volunteering to help the homeless, and being named to the National Honor Society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Though they are called Dreamers, these young people are doers, in the best American tradition,” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “They are undocumented through no fault of their own. And when our government offered them an opportunity to come out of the shadows, they did — because they trusted that they would not be punished for doing so. I believe that as a nation we owe them fairness and certainty.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brief was submitted in support of the plaintiffs in &lt;em&gt;State of California, et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et. al&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Regents of University of California, et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al.&lt;/em&gt;, and was filed on Nov. 1. For purposes of the issues the court is currently considering, these cases have been consolidated with two other cases challenging DACA. MIT expects to join its peers in filing a similar brief in a lawsuit filed in New York by 16 states (including Massachusetts) and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal residents hope for permanent status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DACA program, established by the Obama administration in 2012, applies to about 800,000 U.S. residents who were brought to the country as children but have not acquired legal immigration status. In September, the Trump administration announced the rescission of the DACA program, effective in March 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under DACA, Dreamers were permitted to reside in the U.S. without fear of deportation and were able to obtain authorization to work legally. DACA protection lasted for two years (with renewals possible) but did not include a standardized path to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the specific terms of the rescission, those with DACA status could lose their protections as early as March 2018, although some have applied for a two-year extension of this protection before an October 2017 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT’s amicus brief makes the case that DACA recipients, who by definition are the product of this nation’s education system, have much to give back to the country that raised them. Rescinding DACA, the brief argues, would waste a tremendous national investment by forcing these talented young people to return to the shadows of our society.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every MIT student deserves the same opportunities to study, to work, to travel — in short, to thrive here,” says MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart. “By joining our peer institutions in filing this amicus brief to preserve the DACA program, we are again showing that MIT stands firmly behind our nation&#039;s Dreamers. And by continuing to provide MIT’s DACA students with the direct support and resources they need during this uncertain time, we are showing that our commitment to them will not change, regardless of what happens in Washington.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;/ABC News poll released in September, 86 percent of respondents said they supported the DACA program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview: MIT’s resources for Dreamers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new amicus brief is one example of many activities MIT has engaged in to support international members of its community in the face of changing immigration policy. These measures include public advocacy on the subject by MIT President L. Rafael Reif, dedicated legal support for DACA students, information briefings on campus, an MI
000028E5
T working group to monitor post-election changes in federal policies, and multiple open letters to the entire MIT community informing them about the Institute&#039;s evolving efforts and resources on this front. MIT has also joined with groups of colleges and universities to issue open letters in support of DACA and the Dreamers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;President Reif has emerged as a high-profile advocate on behalf of the Dreamers. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/08/31/trump-shouldn-repeal-daca/9sqIjciw0UseCKGTSVCRlK/story.html&quot;&gt;an opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; on Aug. 31, he stated that pushing Dreamers out of the U.S. would constitute &quot;throwing away a tremendous national investment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Reif added, terminating the DACA program would also be &quot;a violation of deep American principles. The plight of the Dreamers presents a profound question of fairness. Often starting from harsh personal circumstances, these young people have done what any American family might dream of for their child: Study hard, aim high, and earn a degree or a place in college or the military, on the road to a productive career.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reif also joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dreamcoalition.us/&quot;&gt;Dream Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit advocacy group with national scope that is seeking a permanent legislative solution for DACA-eligible U.S. residents — a step he also endorsed in his &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; piece.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This fall, MIT partnered with an outside immigration attorney to provide all DACA students with free legal consultations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January of 2017, MIT also established a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chancellor.mit.edu/monitoring-student-access-issues&quot;&gt;Post-Election Working Group&lt;/a&gt; to monitor and evaluate the evolution of federal policy regarding immigration and other related topics. In coordination with the Office of the Chancellor and the Office of the General Counsel, the group, chaired by associate professor of history Christopher Capozzola, has hosted two on-campus immigration briefings to inform the community of current developments. MIT has also developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://chancellor.mit.edu/faq-information-about-undocumented-students-at-mit&quot;&gt;FAQ pages&lt;/a&gt; available to the community, and, through the International Students Office and International Scholars Office, provides travel advice and other guidance to students and community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This September, MIT joined a letter issued by 57 members of the Association of American Universities, calling for Congress to enact permanent legislation on DACA. In October, MIT was one of nearly 800 institutions signing on to a letter from the American Council on Education that also called for a “long-term legislative fix as soon as possible to protect Dreamers,” terming such a policy “in America’s best interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-medical-shatters-previous-one-day-flu-shot-record-1101</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Oct. 24, social media lit up with photos and updates from MIT’s annual flu shot clinic in Walker Memorial, as “#10Kin1Day” rapidly became the top-trending Twitter hashtag in Cambridge, Massachusetts. With MIT Medical publicizing a goal of 10,000 shots in one day and handing out a numbered sticker with every vaccine, the Institute community turned out to get their shots — and spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Such an impressive operation. I was in and out in 2 minutes,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/TaryMellers/status/922866662730338304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&amp;nbsp;@TaryMellers&lt;/a&gt;, along with a photo of the sticker identifying her as “flu shot number 01216.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks MIT. Great place to work and huge lines that are MUCH faster than Disney,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mcubstea/status/922910613608771586&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted Matt Cubstead&lt;/a&gt;, an administrative officer in the Department of Physics, who received shot number 5347.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I come for the flu shots, I stay for the A+ operations management,” tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/CollinLi/status/922923504403587074&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;graduate student Colin Li&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a photo of sticker number 06125.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this year’s clinic lived up to its reputation as one of the most efficient operations at MIT, giving an average of one shot every 4.8 seconds with wait times rarely exceeding 10 minutes, even at peak hours. And although MIT Medical fell short of its 10K goal, the final shot count shattered the previous one-day record of 5,154 vaccines and exceeded the prediction of senior Malte Ahrens, who began a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tgx6xhhxuEk0j
00002601
JWDDoA6pjMiZ_digRhExpWY77dZPY/edit#gid=1840095871&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;live survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;during the afternoon where students could add their shot number and time received. With an r-squared value of 0.991, Ahrens predicted a total of 7,324 vaccinations by 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In fact, the last sticker of the day was number 7,455,” says MIT Medical&amp;nbsp;Marketing and Communications Director David Tytell, “but we estimate that a number of people managed to get a vaccine without receiving a sticker first thing in the morning. Once all the shots are tallied, the final count should be closer to 7,500.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the dream of 10K lives on for 2018, says Medical Director Cecilia Stuopis. “We’ve come away from this year’s clinic with ideas for making next year’s even bigger and better,” she promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be good news for graduate student Simona Dalin, who calls MIT Medical’s annual flu clinic “the best day of the year at MIT.” Explaining her enthusiasm to a non-MIT friend on Facebook, Dalin wrote, “It’s the most amazing marvel of people coming together and working well together to accomplish a goal. [It’s] so awesome to see the human machine just work. I’m sad that it’s already over and I need to wait a whole year to experience it again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you miss last week’s clinic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional campus walk-in clinics are scheduled for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;November 2, 1-4 p.m., Atlas Service Center, Building E17&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;November 7, 6:30-10 a.m., MIT Medical Room 009, Building E23&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;November 16, 3-6 p.m., Tang Center, Building E51&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinics are open to all &lt;a href=&quot;http://medical.mit.edu/flu#eligibility&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eligible&amp;nbsp;members&lt;/a&gt; of the MIT community, ages 10 and up. Individuals who can’t make it to a clinic can call the MIT Medical Flu Line at 617-253-4865 to schedule a vaccination appointment.

    <title>Connecting through conversation</title>
    <link>http://news.mit.edu/2017/student-profile-joshua-charles-woodard-1101</link>
    <description>Whether in Cambridge or Shanghai, MIT senior Joshua Charles Woodard seeks to learn from others’ perspectives and challenge his own.  </description>
     <pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

 <guid isPermaLink="true">http://news.mit.edu/2017/student-profile-joshua-charles-woodard-1101</guid>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last year, during a reception on campus, MIT senior Joshua Charles Woodard was introduced to Claire Conceison, the Quanta Professor of Chinese Culture and professor of theater arts. The two proceeded to have a conversation in Mandarin, Woodard’s minor, which ended with an on-the-spot invitation for Woodard to visit Shanghai and study Beijing opera for two weeks with a small group of her students.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woodard savored the experience and, as he now considers a career in diplomacy and East Asian affairs, still marvels at how one discussion had such a significant impact on his world view and his plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The story may not be surprising to those who know Woodard, however, because striking up conversations to share different perspectives is one of his many pastimes. Whether making friends in foreign countries, discussing Institute policies as a member of the eight-student advisory cabinet convened by MIT President L. Rafael Reif, or serving as co-chair of the student community and living group Chocolate City, Woodard is always up for a discussion that leads to learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He dreams of a “willingness to connect the dots,” for people to acknowledge commonalities between different cultures despite nationalistic identities in an increasingly globalized world. “If I don’t reach across the aisle,” he says, “No one is going to.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposing kids to STEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long before he set his eyes on policy and diplomacy, Woodard, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago, envisioned a future in engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Childhood experiences with LEGO robotics and Northwestern University game design courses gave Woodard a foundation in STEM. By the time he was in the seventh grade, he knew he wanted to attend MIT for engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he acknowledges most students from his community don’t have those childhood experiences that enable them to have similar goals. “I had a chance that others didn’t have,” he says, “Anybody can do what I’ve done, but it’s only a matter of exposure and getting to [students] early.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a junior at MIT, the mechanical engineering major worked on making those opportunities more available to underrepresented minorities, by co-founding the MIT BoSTEM Scholars Academy. The
00004000
 four-week summer program gives high school students valuable experiences in STEM and aims to put them on the path to MIT and other universities. Woodard worked with his co-founder Javier Weddington to raise $18,000 to fund the program, which debuted the summer of 2017 and will continue in the coming summers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An expanding worldview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Woodard was 16, he visited Paris on a school field trip. While he was purchasing items at a grocery store, a store employee complained to him about having to learn English to accommodate American tourists. The critique went further, and Woodard listened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Woodard, the experience was “a pretty direct challenge to my world views [as an American], and the starting point for me to form a framework for how to study the world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he meets someone with a different cultural view, he opts to share his perspective with them and also listen to theirs. As an example, he describes his thought process when meeting someone who may not understand the meaning of the Black Lives Matter movement: “You have a set of experiences that didn’t expose you to this. If me taking half an hour to explain it to you can change your worldview so you can help someone else in the future, then it’s worth my time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During orientation for the class of 2021, Woodard gave a speech to the incoming class about the impact personal experiences can have on the MIT community. He told a story about the frustration he felt when multiple Black Lives Matter posters on campus were vandalized, but how caring gestures from others reminded him of the value of openly discussing personal and controversial issues. At the end of his speech, Woodard urged students to “open your minds and hearts so you can learn from the world” and ultimately better their communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chocolate City, a New House dorm community of current and former MIT students who share common backgrounds, interests, ethnicities, and experiences, further drives Woodard’s passion for conversation and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chocolate City encourages its members to use their experiences to benefit the people from their cultural communities. As co-chair, Woodard spearheaded local outreach initiatives, led the efforts to work with the Institute’s administration to preserve the group’s on-campus housing, and encouraged members to engage in leadership positions throughout campus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the other students who made up the Presidential Advisory Cabinet, Woodard discussed with President Reif a wide range of issues affecting the MIT student body, from the current political climate, to campus infrastructure, to issues of particular importance to MIT communities of color such as recruitment and retention of faculty from underrepresented minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diplomat in the making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woodard’s affinity for connecting with others should serve him well in his area of interest after graduation, which is diplomacy and East Asian affairs, perhaps through work with the State Department.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Describing his belief that all human beings share a common set of values and desires, Woodard says, “That’s the type of mentality you’d have to have in foreign diplomacy.” After graduating from MIT, he hopes to continue to learn about the United States’s impact on developed and developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woodard’s minor is Mandarin, which he says he chose over other languages due to China’s explosive economic growth and investment in America’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During his Mandarin class, he “can learn about culture and learn about the world,” he says. He enjoys taking part in discussions on topics ranging from China’s one-child policy, to tiger moms, to Chinese internet censorship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, for Woodard, Mandarin is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to know four languages by the time I’m 30: English, Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish. In that order,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shutterbug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woodard’s skills with both people and cameras also led him to launch his own photography business, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jcwoodardphotography/&quot;&gt;JC Woodard Photography&lt;/a&gt;, during his first year at MIT. Since then, he has taken photos for sororities, fraternities, MIT events, as well as professional headshots for the MIT community. Most recently, he covered comedian Hasan Minhaj’s performance at MIT’s Fall Festival this past September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s exciting to capture people in moments of emotion,” he says. “Preserving the moment is so cool.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He suspects his photography skill benefits from his personality. “I don’t know how not to smile, so I’m really personable,” he says, “If you give me a camera, I’m like ‘Hey! Give me a smile, let’s take a picture!’”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Promise seen in possible treatment for autism spectrum disorder</title>

    <description>Studies in mice show improved social interaction and cognition from a potential therapeutic for a syndrome that often results in autism. </description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is caused by the absence of about 27 genes on chromosome&amp;nbsp;16. This deletion is characterized by intellectual disability; impaired language, communication, and socialization skills;&amp;nbsp;and autism spectrum disorder or ASD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research from the laboratories of &lt;a href=&quot;http://picower.mit.edu/mark-bear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Bear&lt;/a&gt; at MIT and Jacqueline Crawley at the University of California at Davis, has identified a potential therapeutic for ASD. Researchers found that R-Baclofen reverses cognitive deficits and improves social interactions in two lines of 16p11.2 deletion mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/vaop/naam/abs/npp2017236a.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology, &lt;/em&gt;have the potential to treat humans with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our collaborative teams found that treatment with the drug R-baclofen improved scores on several learning and memory tasks, and on a standard assay of social behavior, in 16p11.2 mutant mice,” says&amp;nbsp;Crawley, co-senior author of the paper along with Bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This unique corroboration of findings by two independent labs, using two distinct lines of mice with the same mutation, increases confidence that R-baclofen may be an effective pharmacological treatment for some of the symptoms of human 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, including intellectual impairment and autism,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These findings are particularly exciting on two fronts,” says Bear, who is the Picower Professor of Neuroscience at MIT. “First, the results show that diverse genetic causes of intellectual disability and autism may converge on a limited number of pathophysiological processes that can be ameliorated pharmacologically. Thus, a treatment for one genetically defined disorder may be beneficial for another with phenotypic overlap. Second, R-Baclofen has a well-understood safety profile and is well-tolerated in children and adults, making clinical studies feasible in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing knowledge about genetic mutations in people with autism is enabling researchers to evaluate hypothesis-driven pharmacological interventions in terms of&amp;nbsp;their ability to reverse the biological and behavioral consequence of specific mutations that cause autism. One of the genes in the 16p11.2 deletion region regulates the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Researchers tested the hypothesis that increasing GABA neurotransmission using R-baclofen, which binds to GABA-B receptors, could reverse analogous behavioral symptoms in a mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current paper, researchers report the results of animal model studies using two independently derived lines of mutant mice, each missing a chromosomal region analogous to human 16p11.2. Normal and mutant mice at both labs were tested after receiving R-baclofen in their drinking water on three tasks: novel object recognition, object location memory, and contextual recognition learning and memory. In addition, R-baclofen treated mutant mice scored better after treatment on each cognitive task than the untreated mutant mice. R-baclofen also increased scores on a standard assay of mouse social behaviors — male-female reciprocal social interactions — in the 16p11.2 mutant mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that R-baclofen should be explored for the treatment of cognitive phenotypes in affected humans.&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While MIT&#039;s Violence Prevention and Response (VPR) program stages special events and communications to mark the 30th annual National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, VPR staff work year-round to educate students, faculty, and staff on sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, harassment, and stalking, and to support community members who are victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A month of awareness activities in October help VPR and student allies advance conversations about topics like intimate partner violence,” says&amp;nbsp;Kelley Adams, assistant dean and director of VPR in the Division of Student Life. “But, it’s important to remember that making significant progress on prevention requires ongoing efforts that continue well after awareness months have passed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT Vice President Suzy Nelson, the dean for student life, says the Institute&#039;s VPR team members “are caring, compassionate, and conscientious, and always willing to help students and other community members who are experiencing violence in their relationships, or feeling threatened or intimidated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The activities of VPR and student allies send powerful messages that intimate partner violence is never OK at MIT or anywhere else,” Nelsons says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff are available by appointment during working hours, or anytime through VPR’s 24-hour hotline at 617-253-2300.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), one in three women and one in four men have been victims of physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner in their lifetimes. Likewise, one in seven women and one in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner. Annually, more than 10 million women and men in the U.S. are physically abused by an intimate partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, VPR posted NCADV data on social media, accompanied by reminders that VPR supports any community member who has been affected — directly or indirectly — by relationship violence. Through the end of October, MIT hosts the Silent Witness Project, a striking visual display of life-sized silhouettes that tell the stories of domestic violence homicide victims. This international initiative started in 1990 when a group of women artists, writers, and women’s organizations in Minnesota used silhouettes to tell the stories of 26 women who died in acts of domestic violence. A 27th silhouette was added to signify women who died by the hand of a husband, ex-husband, partner, or acquaintance, but whose deaths were unsolved or ruled accidental. The Silent Witness project will be on the first floor of the Stratton Student Center (Building W20) until Nov. 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic Violence Awareness Month is happening at a remarkable time. The #metoo social media campaign was created 10 years ago to help people understand the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in society, but has seen a resurgence recently. Many victims have embraced #metoo, while others have chosen not to share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important to acknowledge people may have a wide range of reactions to #metoo, ranging from anger and frustration to validation and feeling less alone,” Adams says. “The decision to speak out about one’s own experiences of harassment or assault is a personal one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, sexual and relationship violence remain serious and widespread issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sexual assault and sexual harassment happen to people of all identities and in a range of circumstances, from intimate settings to the workplace,” Adams says. “We hope that the information VPR shared in October will encourage anyone at MIT who has experienced partner violence to reach out to us. We are here to help anyone who needs it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mars city living: Designing for the Red Planet</title>

    <description>A multidisciplinary team of MIT students and postdocs wins an international competition focused on building sustainably on Mars. </description>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How will people live on Mars? An MIT team developed a design concept addressing this question as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marscitydesign.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mars City Design&lt;/a&gt; 2017, an international competition focused on sustainable cities on Mars to be built in the next century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT’s winning urban design, titled Redwood Forest, creates domes or tree habitats that can each house up to 50 people. The domes provide open, public spaces containing plants and abundant water, which would be harvested from the northern plains of Mars. The tree habitats sit atop a network of underground tunnels, or roots, providing access to private spaces and easy, shirt-sleeve transportation to the other tree habitants in the community of 10,000. In addition to connectivity, the roots offer residents protection from cosmic radiation, micrometeorite impacts, and extreme thermal variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT postdoc Valentina Sumini and Assistant Professor Caitlin Mueller, who teaches in both departments of Architecture and Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), led the interdisciplinary team effort, which included nine MIT students from different departments and research groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumini describes the project’s design fundamentals and forest metaphor: “On Mars, our city will physically and functionally mimic a forest, using local Martian resources such as ice and water, regolith (or soil), and sun to support life. Designing a forest also symbolizes the potential for outward growth as nature spreads across the Martian landscape. Each tree habitat incorporates a branching structural system and an inflated membrane enclosure, anchored by tunneling roots. The design of a habitat can be generated using a computational form-finding and structural optimization workflow developed by the team. The design workflow is parametric, which means that each habitat is unique and contributes to a diverse forest of urban spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team aims to build a comfortable environment for inhabitants while using location and system architecture focused on sustainability, a critical component for any Mars community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics doctoral student and Systems Design and Management Fellow George Lordos MBA &#039;00, who was responsible for the system architecture of Redwood Forest, pointed out the central role of water in building vibrant communities on Mars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every tree habitat in Redwood Forest will collect energy from the sun and use it to process and transport the water throughout the tree, and every tree is designed as a water-rich environment,” says Lordos. “Water fills the soft cells inside the dome providing protection from radiation, helps manage heat loads, and supplies hydroponic farms for growing fish and greens. Solar panels produce energy to split the stored water for the production of rocket fuel, oxygen, and for charging hydrogen fuel cells, which are necessary to power long-range vehicles as well as provide backup energy storage in case of dust storms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the features of the design could be also useful on Earth, the designers say. Electric vehicles traveling in underground multi-level networks could help ease congested American cities. The tree habitat design could create living and working spaces in harsh environments, such as high latitudes, deserts and the sea floor. Hydroponic gardening beneath cities could provide fresh fish, fruits, and vegetables with lower land and transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT team also includes AeroAstro PhD students Samuel Wald, Matthew Moraguez, and Alejandro Trujillo; architecture PhD student Alpha Arsano SM &#039;17 and research fellow Kam-Ming Mark Tam MEng &#039;15; integrated design and management program graduate students Meghan Maupin and John Stillman; and civil and environmental engineering undergraduate student Zoe Lallas.&lt;/p&gt;
